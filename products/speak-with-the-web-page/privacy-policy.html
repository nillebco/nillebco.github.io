    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: 2025-02-25</strong></p>
    
    <p>Thank you for using <strong>Speak with the Web Page</strong> ("the Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use the Extension.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>The Extension collects and processes the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI API Key</strong>: The Extension requires your OpenAI API key to interact with the OpenAI real-time voice API. Your API key is stored in your browser’s local storage and is only used to send requests to OpenAI’s API. The Extension does not transmit or share this key with any other service or third party.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice Preference</strong>: The Extension stores your selected voice preference (among the ones available via OpenAI) in your browser’s local storage to improve your experience. This data is not shared externally.</li>
        <li><strong>Webpage Access</strong>: The Extension requires access to all visited webpages to enable its functionality, allowing you to interact with any page via voice. However, the Extension does not store or transmit your browsing history.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone Access</strong>: The Extension requires microphone access to capture voice input. A consent prompt will be displayed, and without user approval, the Extension will not function. The recorded audio is sent only to OpenAI for processing and is not stored locally or transmitted elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All stored data (API key and voice preference) is kept within the browser’s local storage. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers beyond OpenAI’s API endpoints.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>The Extension does not collect, store, or share your personal data with any third parties. Your OpenAI API key and voice data are exclusively used for communication with OpenAI’s API.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your stored data within your browser. However, you are responsible for keeping your OpenAI API key secure, as it is stored locally on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>5. User Control</h2>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Delete or modify your OpenAI API key and voice preferences at any time through the Extension’s settings.</li>
        <li>Revoke microphone permissions via your browser settings.</li>
        <li>Disable or uninstall the Extension if you no longer wish to use it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a revised "Last Updated" date. We encourage users to review this policy periodically.</p>
