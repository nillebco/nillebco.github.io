In today's digital landscape, where reading dense web pages can be exhausting—especially for users with visual impairments or eye strain—traditional accessibility tools often fall short. To address this gap, I built a Chrome extension that transforms how we interact with web content using real-time voice capabilities powered by OpenAI.

Unlike conventional summarization tools, this extension is designed to **answer questions about a web page**. Summaries tend to flatten nuance, highlighting only the main points. By contrast, conversational AI allows users to explore a page's depth: asking clarifying questions, drilling down into specific sections, or retrieving background context—without needing to scroll or read line-by-line.

Importantly, the AI isn't confined to the content of the page. It leverages the full breadth of the OpenAI model’s general knowledge to enrich answers, explain terminology, or make connections beyond the immediate text. This hybrid of context-aware and world-aware reasoning is what makes it more than just a voice reader.

Beyond Q&A, the extension allows for **basic interaction with the page itself**, such as changing the background color via voice commands. This opens the door to more dynamic forms of interaction, suggesting a new paradigm for accessibility interfaces.

At its core, this project is not simply a Chrome extension—it's an **experiment in human-machine interaction**. Ideally, such features would be integrated at the operating system or browser layer. But for now, this tool is something I use every day to give my eyes a break—and to explore what more intuitive, voice-driven access to the web might look like.
