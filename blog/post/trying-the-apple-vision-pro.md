# Trying the Apple Vision Pro

What has most impressed me about this trial are the immersive experiences, such as watching an NBA match from the court side, walking on a rope suspended between two cliffs and the "peaceful moments".

There's also a very important consideration, brought by my friend Paolo: given the incredible resolution of the Apple Vision Pro, you could just consider replacing your displays with such a device. Recently a patch has been released (wide and ultrawide) to improve the resolution of your mac devices on the apple vision pro screen.

Also impressive: the precision of the eye tracking, the sound clarity. I would like to take a spatial video or picture to revive those moments.

In negative: viewing the real world through the AVP seemed blurry. I thought that it was because of the Zeiss implants, but my friend Paolo had the same feedback. Also, it was not clear where the gestures where going to be "sensed‚Äùby the device (found out later that you just need to keep your hands close to the body, visible *below* the AVP.
