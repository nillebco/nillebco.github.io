# The business year is over

Wow.

Administratively speaking, the business year is over (I’ve received the last payment for this year, the next ones will be assigned in the new enterprise).

This month of December is strange, in the sense that the amount of work is minimal compared to usual. So I can focus on maintenance and improving my work tools. At the same time I can plan a visit to people I loved to work with during the year.

A bit fo sadness surfaces, this will be the end of the first version of nillebco; now let’s move to nillebco 2.0 :)
